        <h1>Discover the World of Coffee</h1>
        <p><strong>WelCome to the delightful world of coffee, where every cup tells a story of flavor, culture, and
                craftsmanship. Whether you're a seasoned coffee aficionado or just beginning your journey into the realm
                of caffeinated bliss,there's always something new and exciting to learn about this beloved beverage.<br>
                The New World's hot, tropical weather was seen as a new ideal for the cultivation of coffee, and coffee
                plantations quickly spread throughout Central America, with their first coffee harvest occurring in
                1726.
                <br>
                Latin American countries also have ideal coffee-growing conditions, such as a good balance of sunshine
                and rain, high and humid temperatures, and rich soil. By the mid-18th century, Latin American countries
                evolved into being some of the top coffee producers, able to clear big tropical forests, ready for
                plantations. And today, Brazil is the world's biggest coffee producer.
                <br>
                Now that we have explored coffee history briefly, why not discover the NESCAFÉ® contribution to
                coffee?</strong></p>

            <h1>Origin and Evolution</h>
                <p><strong>Coffee finds its roots in the highlands of Ethiopia, where a goat herder first discovered its
                        stimulating effects. Today, Arabica and robusta beans flourish in diverse climates, from
                        Colombia's mountains to Vietnam's lush fields. The art of roasting transforms these beans into a
                        spectrum of flavors and aromas, from bright and acidic to deep and chocolatey.</strong></p>
